# Project 4 - A Pulse-Width Modulator IP Block

NOTE: I submitted videos of my Blackboard with my IDE's running, along with the system. Currenlty, the LED's get stuck on LED 4, and the RGB is unable to show an output. Both correclty have built IP for both the equired LED's and PWD. 

Part 1-  PWM with LED's

Part 2-  PWM with rgb-LED's
